## Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Introduction 

This is a web application designed to enhance daily productivity by allowing users to challenge each other to complete various tasks. They are designed around building positive habits and a friendly competition with friends. 

By integrating social interaction, the app transforms mundane tasks into an exciting game. Users can compete with friends, aiming to earn streak rewards for consistent performance.

### 2️⃣ Benefits

* 🏋️ Fitness (e.g., "Run 5km today")
* 📖 Reading (e.g., "Read 10 pages")
* 💰 Saving Money (e.g., "Save $10 today")
* 🥗 Healthy Eating (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water")
* 🧘 Mindfulness (e.g., "Meditate for 5 minutes")
* ✍️ Custom Challenge (User-defined)

### 3️⃣ Why Build This? 

Our app creates a dynamic platform where we can share our success stories and the challenges we've overcome, fostering a community of motivation and support among us. We can set challenges allowing friends to participate and compete with us. This web app incorporates a streak system, with AI providing encouragement for maintaining high streaks and sending warnings if our streak is about to break. Our friends can also send us encouraging messages, while the AI suggests easier challenges if we're struggling, ensuring continuous engagement and progress.

In this application, we earn points for completing challenges, which can be used to unlock badges for achieving milestones such as 7-day or 30-day streaks. The app features friendly leaderboards, either among our friends or globally, with AI adjusting points based on challenge difficulty to ensure fair play. Monthly leaderboard resets keep the competition fresh for us, while real-time updates via WebSocket maintain excitement. As an added incentive, the AI suggests special rewards, like free e-books for maintaining reading streaks, making our pursuit of productivity both rewarding and enjoyable.
